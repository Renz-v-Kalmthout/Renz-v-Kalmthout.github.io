    <h1>Home</h1>
      <p>This is the homepage of my site. On this site I will keep track of my course,<br>
      Tell you more of myself, Give my opinion on the course so far and continually add <br>
      questions I didn't knew the answers to.</p>
    <div>
      <h2>My thoughts on this course:</h2>
      <p>I think this course suits me. I do need to rethread a lot of ground already covered,<br>
       but that has re-ignited the flame for coding that I lost a few months ago.<br>
       Coding thus far has been a really relaxing, but sometimes frustrating experience.<br></p>

      <h2>My thoughts on the hbo level:</h2>
      <p>The hbo so far is very relaxed and puts a lot of responsibility on the student itself.<br>
       This can be a hurdle for me as I usually need a little push or reminder to start doing something.<br>
       However the liberated feel of only having one goal, gives you a lot of freedom to go at your own pace.<br></p>
